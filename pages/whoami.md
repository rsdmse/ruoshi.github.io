I am currently a [**Lead Scientist**](/work) working for Research Computing at the University of Virginia, USA.

I was trained in [**Computational Materials Science**](/matsci), specializing in first-principles density-functional theory computational methods to predict materials properties of alloys and semiconductors.

In my spare time, I play the piano, compose and arrange [**music**](/music).

I have translated and self-published several [**go**](/go) (weiqi/baduk) books.
